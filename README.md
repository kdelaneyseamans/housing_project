In this project, I analyzed a housing data set. The focus was analyzing various attributes of a house, such as number of bedrooms or square footage, and how those attributes influenced price of the home. Multiple regression models were constructed to analyze the results. The summary report is attached that tells the story of the data gathered and the implications of the project.
